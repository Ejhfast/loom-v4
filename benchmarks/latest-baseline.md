# Latest benchmark baseline

The measured source revision is `ed220d2`.

The measurements use release builds unless this file states a different build.

The host uses an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor.

The host has 16 physical cores and 32 logical processors.

Release runtime benchmarks use deterministic scheduler mode and zero scheduler workers unless stated otherwise.

The operating system selects processors for each benchmark process.

The bytecode version is 55.

The verifier version is 36.

The snapshot format version is 30.

## Language operations

Each result is the median of at least three benchmark processes.

Each process reports one nine-run median.

| Operation | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| `int_loop` | 33.4 ns |
| `direct_call` | 31.9 ns |
| `string_interp` | 205.9 ns |
| `float_add` | 33.4 ns |
| `string_builder` | 41.9 ns |
| `byte_buffer` | 40.9 ns |
| `direct_clock` | 110.3 ns |

String and interpreter measurements can vary with process placement.

## Workspace suite

The warm debug workspace suite completed in 43.95 seconds.

The suite used Cargo's default test concurrency and full coverage.

The test harness used deterministic mode by default.

Parallel scheduler tests used up to four workers.

CLI integration tests used the parallel default.

The standard codec modules link only when source imports them.

## Scheduler foundation

These results use the deterministic scheduler.

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Proc send and receive | 362.4 ns per message |
| File open and close | 10.731 us per lifecycle |
| Cached 1 KiB file read | 4.116 us per read |
| In-memory file open and close | 1.666 us per lifecycle |
| One 35 ms sleep | 1 park, 1 timeout wakeup |
| Sleep with a signal guardian | 1 park, 1 timeout wakeup |
| Pure-run allocation gate | fewer than 100 allocations |

The shared host queue removed the ten-millisecond polling interval.

The shared host queue also removed the mixed output and child-wait deadlock.

The owned execution lease passes one real cross-thread execution test.

## Parallel scheduler

These results use parallel scheduler mode and the default 4,096-instruction turn.

Each result is the median of three complete benchmark runs.

Each benchmark run uses nine measured executions after one warm execution.

| Workload | Tasks | Workers | One worker | Stated workers | Speedup |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Integer loop | 2 | 2 | 46.310 ms | 23.187 ms | 2.005x |
| Integer loop | 4 | 4 | 90.844 ms | 24.077 ms | 3.773x |
| Text building | 8 | 4 | 88.099 ms | 23.683 ms | 3.714x |
| Text building | 8 | 8 | 88.099 ms | 14.102 ms | 6.250x |
| Text churn | 8 | 8 | 679.415 ms | 103.645 ms | 6.556x |
| Split n-queens | 12 | 12 | 179.176 ms | 19.635 ms | 9.006x |

The pool starts only when a second task can run.

A root-only parallel run uses the inline execution path.

Boundary-heavy message tasks also remain on the coordinator fast path.

The text-churn row creates one formatted string for each append.

Adaptive local collection limits dead-object retention before the hard heap limit.

### Parallel messages

Each row reports a five-run median and its measured p95.

Each table value is the median of five complete benchmark processes.

The ratio is deterministic time divided by parallel time.

| Case | Messages | Workers | Deterministic | Deterministic p95 | Parallel | Parallel p95 | Ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Ping-pong | 4,003 | 4 | 4.223 ms | 4.391 ms | 4.116 ms | 4.173 ms | 1.026x |
| Stream | 500 | 4 | 0.181 ms | 0.186 ms | 0.180 ms | 0.183 ms | 0.996x |
| Independent pairs | 4,012 | 4 | 4.186 ms | 4.203 ms | 4.245 ms | 4.258 ms | 0.987x |
| Many senders | 800 | 4 | 0.332 ms | 0.336 ms | 0.332 ms | 0.333 ms | 1.007x |
| Allocated stream | 200 | 4 | 0.154 ms | 0.161 ms | 0.155 ms | 0.160 ms | 0.981x |

The aggregate message ratio is 1.011x.

## Host readiness observations

The former host used a ten-millisecond readiness quantum.

Raw terminal input could wait for two quanta. This path could add 20 milliseconds.

A mixed output and child wait could block for more than 15 seconds.

The shared completion queue removed all three conditions.

The execution boundary keeps resource registry updates on the coordinator.
